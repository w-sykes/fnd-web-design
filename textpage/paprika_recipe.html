<p><strong> Where does Paprika come from?</strong></p>
<p> Paprika is a spice that is made from dried and ground red peppers. Paprika also commonly includes ground chili peppers. The peppers required to make paprika historically have grown across North America- especially in Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Paprika used?</strong></p>

<p>Paprika is used to add extra spiciness and a zing of flavor in food. In the countries Argentina, Mexico, Hungary, Serbia, Spain, and Holland, Paprika is frequently used in the cuisine. Paprika is also made with different levels of spiciness in order to provide more variation in food. Depending on the spiciness of the chili peppers used to make paprika, there will be variations in the spiciness. Paprika is commonly sold in mild, medium, and hot levels of spiciness.</p></br>
